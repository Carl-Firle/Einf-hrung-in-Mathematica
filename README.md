# Introduction to Wolfram Mathematica \[German\]
As a medical doctor and researcher, I learned to conduct data analysis using Mathematica \[version 13.1\]. This tool is amazing.
For a friend called Rebekka, I give an introduction to the program in German.

Therefor, you find 4 Mathematica-Notebook-Files \(.nb\). I included audio files to explain the functioning.
Just download the .nb-files and the xlsx.file (and audio files), open them with Wolfram Mathematica and start listening to my voice.

Enjoy the discovery!
